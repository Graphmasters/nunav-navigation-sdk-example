## About the Project

This project provides developers with instructions for integrating a navigation SDK into their Android and iOS apps. Integrating a navigation SDK can enable advanced navigation features such as GPS navigation, map views, and direction calculations in apps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin integrating the navigation SDK, you'll need to meet the following prerequisites:

- Android development environment (for Android integration)
- Xcode and macOS (for iOS integration)
- An API-Key to use the NUNAV SDK services

## Integration

This project is divided into two main directories, one for Android and one for iOS.

### Android

For a step-by-step guide on integrating the navigation SDK into Android, please refer to the [Android directory](Android/).

### iOS

For a step-by-step guide on integrating the navigation SDK into iOS, please refer to the [iOS directory](iOS/).

## Usage

Explain how developers can utilize the navigation features in their apps once the integration is complete. Provide examples and use cases.

## Request an API Key

If you wish to request an API key to use the navigation SDK, please contact us at [Your Email Address](mailto:your-email@example.com). We will be happy to provide you with further information on obtaining an API key.
